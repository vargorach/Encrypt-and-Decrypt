# Encrypt-and-Decrypt
 This program encrypts or decrypts a file and is only exited by typing 3
for the opening message prompt. It encrypts by using a user entered .txt file and encrypting the bytes
with a user provided key. It decrypts by using a user entered .enc file and decrypting the bytes with a
user provided key as well. The difference in techniques is the encryption adds the key bytes and the
decryption subtracts the key bytes.
